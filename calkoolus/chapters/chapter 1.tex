\section{Sets}
Before defining what a function is or what it does, it is important to briefly discuss what goes into function and what comes out. Simply, \textit{sets}\index{set} are a collection of items and each one of those items are usually referred to as \textit{elements}\index{set!element}. Without getting into the weeds of set theory, sets can contain pretty much anything from numbers, functions, and other sets \cite{bookofproof}.

Some common sets that you may be familiar with are the \textit{natural numbers} $\N = \{1,2,3,4,5,\dots\}$, the \textit{integers} $\Z = \{\dots,-2,-1,0,1,2,\dots\}$, and the \textit{real numbers} $\R$, which is usually represented via a number line. Sets can also be intervals on the real line (i.e. [a,b) is an interval on $\R$ containing $a$ but not $b$) or even the possible results of flipping a coin $C = \{H,T\}$.

We will now define the basic notation when dealing with sets and the operations that can be performed on sets. We say that $x$ is an element of a set $A$ with the notation $x \in A$ and when $x$ is not in $A$, we say $x \not\in A$. For example, given the set $A = \{1,2,3,4\}$, we can say that $1 \in A$ is true as well as $5 \not\in A$.

The notion of combining sets comes with \textit{unions}\index{set!union} and \textit{intersections}\index{set!intersection}. Given $A$ and $B$ are sets, the union of $A$ and $B$ is denoted as $A \cup B$ and is equal to the set the contains elements in either $A$ or $B$. Similarly, the intersection between $A$ and $B$ is denoted as $A \cap B$ and is the set that contains elements that are in both $A$ and $B$. For example, given the sets $A = \{1,2,3,4\}$ and $B = \{3,4,5,6\}$, the union and intersection between $A$ and $B$ is

\begin{aequation}
    A \cup B &= \{1,2,3,4,5,6\} \\
    A \cap B &= \{3,4\}
\end{aequation}

Subsets are often used to relate different sets and their elements. A set $A$ is said to be a subset of another set $B$ if all of the elements of $A$ are also within $B$ and is denoted as $A \subseteq B$ and a set $A$ is equal to a set $B$ if and only if $A \subseteq B$ and $B \subseteq A$. An important subset is the empty set represented by the symbols $\varnothing$, $\emptyset$, or simply $\{\}$. It is important to note that the empty set is also a subset of all sets.

Using sets by listing them out can become cumbersome and sometimes confusing, instead set builder notation is used to build a set based on a rule. For example, the set of all positive even integers can be written as

\begin{equation}
    A = \{2,4,6,8,\dots\} = \{z : z \text{ is an positive even integer}\} = \{z : z = 2n, n\in\Z \text{ and } n > 0\}
\end{equation}

\noindent Here, the $:$ stands for "such that" which indicates the rule (the words "such that" or the symbol $|$ is also often used). The \textit{rational numbers} $\Q$ can also be constructed via the integers with

\begin{equation}
    \Q = \{\frac{p}{q} : p,q \in \Z \text{ and } q \neq 0\}
\end{equation}

As mentioned previously, intervals on the real number line can be represented as sets. Given two values $a$ and $b$ and assuming that $a \leq b$, intervals on the real line are represented as

\begin{itemize}
    \item Closed interval: $[a,b] = \{x \in \R : a \leq x \leq b\}$ \hfill \intervalinline{a}{b}{[}{]}
    \item Open interval: $(a,b) = \{x \in \R : a < x < b\}$ \hfill \intervalinline{a}{b}{(}{)}
    \item Half-open interval:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $(a,b] = \{x \in \R : a < x \leq b\}$ \hfill \intervalinline{a}{b}{(}{]}
            \item $[a,b) = \{x \in \R : a \leq x < b\}$ \hfill \intervalinline{a}{b}{[}{)}
        \end{itemize}
    \item Infinite interval:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $(a,\infty) = \{x \in \R: a < x\}$ \hfill \intervalinline{a}{$\infty$}{(}{}
                \item $[a,\infty) = \{x \in \R: a \leq x\}$ \hfill \intervalinline{a}{$\infty$}{[}{}
                \item $(-\infty,b) = \{x \in \R: x < b\}$ \hfill \intervalinline{$-\infty$}{b}{}{)}
            \item $(-\infty,b] = \{x \in \R: x \leq b\}$ \hfill \intervalinline{$-\infty$}{b}{}{]}
            \item $(-\infty,\infty) = \R$ \hfill \intervalinline{$-\infty$}{$\infty$}{}{}
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\noindent Here, the open brackets $($ and $)$ indicate that the respective endpoint is not included, while the closed brackets $[$ and $]$ indicate that the respective endpoint is included in the interval.

The \textit{Cartesian product}\index{set!Cartesian product} is used often to describe ordered pairs or even higher-dimension coordinates. Some examples include the $xy$-plane also known as $\R^2$, 3D space with $\R^3$. The Cartesian product for two sets $A$ and $B$ is defined as 

\begin{equation}
    A \times B = \{(a,b) : a \in A, b \in B\}
\end{equation}

\noindent Note that $A \times B \neq B \times A$ as the operation is order dependent. Higher-order products are defined with sets $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n$ as 

\begin{equation}
    A_1 \times A_2 \times \cdots \times A_n = \{(a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n): a_i \in A_i, i \in \{1,2,\dots,n\}\}
\end{equation}

\noindent As previously mentioned, the 2D plane as well as the 3D plane can be constructed using Cartesian products as well and is done as such with the set of real numbers $\R$

\begin{aequation}
    \R^2 &= \R \times \R = \{(x,y): x,y \in \R\}\\
    \R^3 &= \R \times \R \times \R = \{(x,y,z): x,y,z \in \R\}\\
    & \vdots \\
    \R^n &= \R \times \R \times \dots \times \R = \{(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n) : x_i \in \R, i \in \{1,2,\dots, n\} \}
\end{aequation}

\section{What is a function?}
\textit{Functions}\index{function} are objects in math that describe a relationship or mapping between two sets. Given two sets $X$ and $Y$, a function $f$ maps the elements of $X$, called the \textit{domain}\index{function!domain} of the function, to elements in the set $Y$ called the \textit{codomain}\index{function!codomain} of the function and the relationship is denoted as $f : X \to Y$ ("$f$ maps from $X$ to $Y$") or $y = f(x)$ ("$y$ equals $f$ of $x$" \cite{understandinganalysis}), where $y \in Y$ is known as the \textit{dependent variable}\index{function!dependent variable} and $x \in X$ is known as the \textit{independent variable}\index{function!independent variable} or the \textit{argument}\index{function!argument} of the function. The \textit{range}\index{function!range} of a function is the set of all possible values that $f(x)$ is able to output with $X$ as its domain, note that the range is a subset of $Y$ but is not always equal.

\begin{example}
    Some real-world examples of functions are
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The area of a circle: \dotfill $A(r) = \pi r^2$
        \item The height of a falling ball: \dotfill $h(t) = h_0 + v_0 t - (1/2)gt^2$
        \item Compound interest: \dotfill $A(t) = P(1+\frac{r}{n})^{nt}$
        \item Temperature conversion: \dotfill $C(F) = \frac{5}{9}(F - 32)$
        \item %TODO: add more examples here
    \end{itemize}
    \noindent These examples help model and compute 
\end{example}
