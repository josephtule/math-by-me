\section*{Motivation}

The writing of this text arose from the need of a textbook that covers the topics presented in a standard Calculus sequence in a manner that is more rigorous than the likes of \cite{stewartcalculus} or \cite{thomascalculus} placing more emphasis on set theory and elementary proofs but covering more material than \cite{spivakcalculus} by going into detail on multivariable calculus.
